# A2_Symbolic_Form.lean
Formal verification of the flow-rate function associated with the A2 symbolic
form. This object is the geometric certificate for the propositional proof
complexity lower bound.

The certificate is defined as the product of two real values minus their sum, plus one:
    f(x, y) = (x * y) - (x + y) + 1
The core property is that this function is non-negative when x and y are less than or equal to 1.
