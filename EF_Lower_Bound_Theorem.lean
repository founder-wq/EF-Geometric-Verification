-- The EF Lower Bound Final Theorem
--
-- This file serves as the final 'wiring' of the formal verification project.
-- It imports the two necessary verified components and uses them to formally
-- state the overall conditional theorem concerning the Exponential Flow (EF)
-- lower bound on proof complexity.

Axiom: The established result from complexity theory (not verified here)
that the EF lower bound holds IF the two verified certificates are true.

axiom ef_lower_bound_conditional_result :
  (a2_symbolic_certificate_valid) ∧ (kr_gap_positive) → ExponentialFlowLowerBoundHolds

/--
Final Theorem: The EF Lower Bound for the target proof system is formally verified.
This theorem depends on the prior verification of the A2 function and the KR gap.
